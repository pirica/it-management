# File Upload Modules

This document lists modules within the IT Management system that support file uploads, along with descriptions of their functionality, storage locations, and Apache hardening rules.

## Overview

Most modules that support file uploads have been upgraded to include a drag-and-drop area (`.itm-photo-upload-target`) for improved user experience, consistent with the `modules/tickets/` module.

Upload and tenant file trees are hardened by `itm_ensure_upload_directory()` and `itm_ensure_upload_directory_chain()` in `includes/bootstrap_helpers.php`. **Do not** call bare `mkdir()` for application upload paths.

## Force-create contract (mandatory)

Every `itm_ensure_upload_directory()` call — including each segment walked by `itm_ensure_upload_directory_chain()` — **must force-create** two managed files on that folder:

| File | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **`.htaccess`** | Always **overwritten** with the canonical policy body for that directory (`upload`, `deny_http`, or `deny_all`). Never skip when a file already exists or contains an ITM marker. |
| **`index.html`** | Always **overwritten** with an empty placeholder from `itm_upload_directory_empty_index_html()`. Applies to **all** policies (including `backups/`). |

Success requires all three to exist: the directory, `.htaccess`, and `index.html`.

Empty `index.html` content (managed — do not edit by hand):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>
```

**Every folder** in the project (every directory under the repository root, not only upload trees) **must** have an empty `index.html`. Upload paths also receive managed `.htaccess` via `itm_ensure_upload_directory()`. Missing placeholders are a directory-listing risk; deleted placeholders must be restored on the next ensure or backfill run.

**Do not** create upload folders with bare `mkdir()` and add `.htaccess` / `index.html` manually in a follow-up step — call the helper once so both files are written atomically for that path.

## Upload hardening policies

Canonical **source of truth in code:** `includes/bootstrap_helpers.php` → `itm_upload_directory_policy_body($policy)`. Helpers **always overwrite** existing `.htaccess` on ensure — never skip when a file exists (prevents uploaded `.htaccess` RCE).

| Policy | Marker (first comment) | Directories | `.htaccess` role | `index.html` | HTTP access |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `upload` | `ITM upload hardening` | `images/`, `tickets_photos/`, `floor_plans/` | Disable PHP/script execution; allow static assets | Empty placeholder | Static files served directly by Apache |
| `deny_http` | `ITM files hardening` | `files/` and every segment under `files/{company_id}/…` | `RewriteRule ^ - [F]` on **each** folder in the chain | Empty placeholder | **Denied** — serve through `modules/explorer/file.php` |
| `deny_all` | `ITM backup hardening` | `backups/` | `Require all denied` | Empty placeholder | Fully blocked |

### Canonical `.htaccess` bodies (managed — do not edit by hand)

**`deny_http`** (`files/` tree — Explorer, private contacts, notes attachments):

```apache
# ITM files hardening — do not remove (managed by itm_ensure_upload_directory)
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^ - [F]
Options -Indexes -ExecCGI
```

**`upload`** (`images/`, `tickets_photos/`, `floor_plans/`):

```apache
# ITM upload hardening — do not remove (managed by itm_ensure_upload_directory)
Options -Indexes -ExecCGI -MultiViews
<IfModule mod_php7.c>
    php_flag engine off
</IfModule>
<IfModule mod_php.c>
    php_flag engine off
</IfModule>
<IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
    <FilesMatch "(?i)\.(php|phtml|php3|php4|php5|phar|cgi|pl|py|asp|aspx|jsp|sh|exe|bat|cmd)$">
        Require all denied
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
<IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
    <FilesMatch "(?i)\.(php|phtml|php3|php4|php5|phar|cgi|pl|py|asp|aspx|jsp|sh|exe|bat|cmd)$">
        Order allow,deny
        Deny from all
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
RemoveHandler .php .phtml .phar .cgi .pl .py
RemoveType .php .phtml .phar .cgi .pl .py
```

**`deny_all`** (`backups/`):

```apache
# ITM backup hardening — do not remove (managed by itm_ensure_upload_directory)
Options -Indexes -ExecCGI
<IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
    Require all denied
</IfModule>
<IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</IfModule>
```

Empty `index.html` on every ensured folder (all policies):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>
```

### `/files/` chain example

For `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{user_id}/private_contacts/`, the system **force-creates** managed `.htaccess` and empty `index.html` on:

- `files/`
- `files/{company_id}/`
- `files/{company_id}/Common/` (when created)
- `files/{company_id}/Private/`
- `files/{company_id}/Departments/` (when created)
- `files/{company_id}/Trash/` (when created)
- `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{user_id}/`
- `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{user_id}/private_contacts/`

For **employee profile photos** (`files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{employee_id}/profile/`), the same chain applies through `Private/{username}_{employee_id}/`, then:

- `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{employee_id}/profile/`

Legacy installs may still have `Private/{username}_{linked_user_id}/profile/`; `emp_profile_photo_serve_path()` falls back to that path when `employees.user_id` is set.

`modules/explorer/file.php` allows any authenticated company user to read `Private/*/profile/` assets (employee profile thumbnails). Other `Private/` content remains owner-scoped.

Explorer sidebar **Profile Storage** opens this folder for the logged-in user. The **Birthdays** module (`modules/birthdays/index.php`) is read-only — no uploads — but displays profile thumbnails via `emp_profile_photo_url()` → `itm_files_serve_url()`. See **§13 Birthdays**.

**Runtime tenant trees** under `files/{company_id}/**` must **not** be committed to git — helpers create and harden them on deploy.

### Helpers (mandatory for new code)

| Helper | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `itm_ensure_upload_directory($path, $policy)` | Single directory — force-writes `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` |
| `itm_ensure_upload_directory_chain($path, $policy, $anchorRoot)` | Walk anchor→leaf; force-writes `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` on **every** segment |
| `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory($absolutePath)` | Any path under `files/` — `deny_http` chain from `files/` root |
| `itm_files_serve_url($relativePath)` | Build `../../modules/explorer/file.php?path=…` for UI `<img>` / download links |
| `itm_upload_directory_empty_index_html()` | Canonical empty `index.html` body (used internally; do not duplicate) |

### Is `RewriteRule ^ - [F]` the best approach?

**For `files/` — yes, as the primary control**, combined with:

1. **PHP proxy serving** (`modules/explorer/file.php`) so authorised users still see images/files after direct HTTP is blocked.
2. **Per-segment `.htaccess`** so a malicious upload cannot relax rules in a child folder when parent rules are missing.
3. **Force-overwriting** managed `.htaccess` and empty `index.html` on every ensure (never “skip if exists”) so uploaded `.htaccess` files cannot append RCE directives and deleted `index.html` files are restored.
4. **Upload filters** (blocked extensions and dotfiles) in `modules/explorer/api.php`.

**For public asset dirs** (`images/`, `tickets_photos/`, `floor_plans/`) use the `upload` policy instead — those URLs must remain directly servable. `RewriteRule ^ - [F]` alone is insufficient there; the existing `upload` policy disables script execution while allowing images/PDFs.

**Defence in depth:** keep uploads outside the web root where possible, validate MIME/types server-side, and never rely on `.htaccess` when the app may run on nginx or without `AllowOverride`.

## Modules

### 1. Tickets
- **Path:** `modules/tickets/create.php`
- **Storage:** `tickets_photos/` (`upload` policy via `config/config.php`)
- **Description:** Allows uploading multiple photos for ticket records.
- **Implementation:** Uses `itm-photo-upload-target` with drag-and-drop support (via `js/itm-upload-helper.js`).

### 2. Calendar
- **Path:** `modules/calendar/index.php`
- **Description:** Supports importing events from an ICS file.
- **Implementation:** Upgraded to include a drag-and-drop area for `.ics` files (via `js/itm-upload-helper.js`). Works independently of theme initialization.

### 3. Employees
- **Paths:** `modules/employees/index.php` (import); `modules/employees/create.php`, `modules/employees/edit.php` (profile photo); `modules/employees/includes/profile_fields.php` (photo UI); `modules/employees/includes/profile_birthday_fields.php` (`birthday`, `hide_year`)
- **Storage (import):** Client-side only — Excel (.xlsx, .xls) or CSV parsed in the browser; no server upload path for import files.
- **Storage (profile photo):** `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{employee_id}/profile/` (`deny_http` chain) — see **§11 Employee profile photos** below.
- **Description:** Index supports bulk employee import via drag-and-drop. Create/edit support profile photo (PNG/JPG), `birthday`, and `hide_year`. Photo upload requires employee `username` and row `id`; filenames are `{username}_{employee_id}.png` or `.jpg`.
- **Implementation:** Import uses `.itm-photo-upload-target` via `js/itm-upload-helper.js`. Profile photo uses `.itm-employee-photo-target` and `js/itm-upload-helper.js`; upload and serve logic live in `includes/employee_profile_photo.php`.

### 4. Equipment
- **Path:** `modules/equipment/create.php` (and `edit.php` via inclusion)
- **Storage:** `images/` (`upload` policy)
- **Description:** Allows uploading one or more photos during equipment creation or editing.
- **Implementation:** Upgraded to include a drag-and-drop area with photo preview integration and auto-upload on selection during edit (via `js/itm-upload-helper.js`).

### 5. Events
- **Path:** `modules/events/index.php`
- **Description:** Provides functionality to import events from an ICS file.
- **Implementation:** Upgraded to include a drag-and-drop area for `.ics` files (via `js/itm-upload-helper.js`). Logic fixed to avoid redundant listener attachments.

### 6. Patches & Updates
- **Paths:** `modules/patches_updates/create.php`, `modules/patches_updates/edit.php`, `modules/patches_updates/index.php`, `modules/patches_updates/list_all.php`, `modules/patches_updates/view.php`
- **Storage:** `tickets_photos/` (`upload` policy)
- **Description:** Includes photo upload functionality for patch records across various views.
- **Implementation:** All relevant views upgraded to use `itmUploadHelper.setupByClass(".itm-photo-upload-target")` from `js/itm-upload-helper.js`.

### 7. Settings
- **Path:** `modules/settings/index.php`
- **Storage:** `images/favicons/` (`upload` policy per upload)
- **Description:** Allows uploading a favicon image (.ico) and importing database state from a SQL file.
- **Implementation:** Both favicon and SQL import fields upgraded with drag-and-drop areas (via `js/itm-upload-helper.js`). Restored sidebar visibility toggle logic.

### 8. Floor Plans
- **Path:** `modules/floor_plans/create_upload_view.php`, `modules/floor_plans/gallery_helpers.php`
- **Storage:** `floor_plans/{company_id}/` (`upload` policy via `fp_company_upload_dir()`)
- **Description:** Allows uploading Floor Plans (Gallery/AutoCAD/PDF).
- **Implementation:** Upgraded to include a drag-and-drop area (`.itm-photo-upload-target`) for file uploads (via `js/itm-upload-helper.js`).

### 9. Explorer
- **Paths:** `modules/explorer/api.php`, `modules/explorer/setup.php`, `modules/explorer/file.php`, `modules/explorer/index.php`
- **Storage:** `files/{company_id}/` tree (`deny_http` on every segment, including `Trash/`)
- **Description:** General file management with multi-tenant ACL (`get_full_path`), soft-delete to `Trash/`, and PHP-proxied downloads.
- **Security:** API blocks `Private` and `Departments` roots; UI uses `resolveScopedFolderPath()` for scoped navigation; trash operations are ACL-filtered. See `modules/explorer/AGENT_NOTES.md` and **`AGENTS.md` → Explorer module**.
- **Implementation:** Standard `.itm-photo-upload-target` UI; desktop drag-and-drop upload. All folder creation uses `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()` / `explorer_ensure_dir()`. Block dotfile uploads; managed `.htaccess` overwrites malicious uploads on ensure.
- **Regression scripts:** `php scripts/test_explorer_paths.php`, `php scripts/verify_explorer_zip_leak.php`; `.htaccess` RCE PoC: `verify_explorer_rce_htaccess.php`, `verify_explorer_rce_marker.php`.

### 10. Private Contacts
- **Paths:** `modules/private_contacts/create.php`, `modules/private_contacts/edit.php`
- **Storage:** `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{user_id}/private_contacts/` (`deny_http` chain)
- **Description:** PNG contact photos.
- **Implementation:** Creates storage via `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()`; UI serves images through `itm_files_serve_url()` → `modules/explorer/file.php`.

### 11. Employee profile photos
- **Paths:** `modules/employees/create.php`, `modules/employees/edit.php`, `modules/employees/includes/profile_fields.php`, `includes/employee_profile_photo.php`
- **Storage:** `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{employee_id}/profile/` (`deny_http` chain)
- **Description:** PNG/JPG profile photos; canonical filenames `{username}_{employee_id}.png` or `{username}_{employee_id}.jpg`. Requires employee `username` and row `id` (not a linked login account). `employees.photo` stores the basename; `birthday` and `hide_year` are separate columns (not files).
- **Implementation:** `emp_profile_photo_store_upload()` validates MIME (PNG/JPEG), ensures the folder chain with `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()`, removes the other extension when replacing, and returns the filename for `employees.photo`. UI serves via `emp_profile_photo_url()` → `itm_files_serve_url()` → `modules/explorer/file.php` (company users may read `Private/*/profile/`). Drag-and-drop UI uses `.itm-employee-photo-target` and `js/itm-upload-helper.js`. Forms require `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.

### 12. Notes
- **Path:** `modules/notes/index.php`
- **Storage:** `files/{company_id}/Private/{username}_{user_id}/notes/` (`deny_http` chain)
- **Description:** Image attachments on notes.
- **Implementation:** Creates storage via `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()`; previews/downloads use `itm_files_serve_url()`.

### 13. Birthdays
- **Path:** `modules/birthdays/index.php`
- **Storage:** None — read-only monthly list; no file uploads.
- **Description:** Lists employees with a `birthday` in the selected month. Name column shows optional profile thumbnails (same storage as **§11 Employee profile photos**). Day column uses `emp_format_birthday_day_only()` (day of month without leading zeros). Search queries all visible columns: name, day, and department code.
- **Implementation:** Thumbnails served via `emp_profile_photo_url()` → `itm_files_serve_url()` → `modules/explorer/file.php`. Month filter and **Search (all fields)** on the filter card; table export controls follow standard `table-tools.js` behaviour where enabled.

## Folder creation map (code references)

| Location | Helper / policy | Force-created files per folder |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `config/config.php` | `upload` on `images/`, `tickets_photos/`, `floor_plans/`; `deny_all` on `backups/`; `deny_http` on `files/` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` |
| `modules/explorer/api.php` | `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()` for all folder operations | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` on each chain segment |
| `modules/explorer/setup.php` | `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` on each chain segment |
| `modules/private_contacts/create.php`, `edit.php` | `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` on each chain segment |
| `modules/employees/create.php`, `edit.php` (`includes/employee_profile_photo.php`) | `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` on each chain segment |
| `modules/notes/index.php` | `itm_ensure_files_storage_directory()` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` on each chain segment |
| `modules/floor_plans/gallery_helpers.php` | `itm_ensure_upload_directory($base, 'upload')` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` |
| `modules/settings/index.php` | `itm_ensure_upload_directory($faviconsDirFs, 'upload')` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` |
| `modules/equipment/create.php` | `itm_ensure_upload_directory(UPLOAD_PATH, 'upload')` | `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` |

## Maintenance scripts

| Script | Scope | What it force-writes |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| `php scripts/empty_folders.php` | **Entire project** (every folder under repo root; skips `.git`, `.github`, and other dot dirs) | Empty `index.html` on **every** folder; managed `.htaccess` + `index.html` on upload paths (`images/`, `tickets_photos/`, `floor_plans/`, `backups/`, `files/`) |
| `php scripts/ensure_files_htaccess_chain.php` | `files/` only | `deny_http` `.htaccess` + empty `index.html` on every segment (idempotent) |

Run `empty_folders.php` after deploy, when adding new directories, or when folders were created without placeholders. The script lists only **new or changed** paths (repo-relative `index.html`) before the summary line. A second run on an unchanged tree prints `No new or changed folders.` and reports how many folders were already current.

```bash
php scripts/empty_folders.php
```

Example output (first run after adding folders):

```
Scanning project folders for missing or outdated index.html...

modules/new_module1/index.html
modules/new_module2/index.html
[PASS] Updated 2 folder(s) under /path/to/it-management (0 upload-hardened). 249 already current (251 scanned).
```

Example output (subsequent run — nothing to do):

```
Scanning project folders for missing or outdated index.html...

No new or changed folders.
[PASS] Updated 0 folder(s) under /path/to/it-management (0 upload-hardened). 251 already current (251 scanned).
```

`files/` only (faster when other roots are already correct):

```bash
php scripts/ensure_files_htaccess_chain.php
```

## Technical Standards

- **Shared Utility:** `js/itm-upload-helper.js` provides centralized drag-and-drop logic.
- **CSS Classes:**
  - `.itm-photo-upload-target`: The primary container for the drag-and-drop area.
  - `.is-dragover`: Applied to the target during drag events to provide visual feedback.
  - `.itm-dropzone-hint`: Used for instructional text within the dropzone.
- **JavaScript:** Implementation involves using `itmUploadHelper.setupById(targetId, inputId)` or `itmUploadHelper.setupByClass(className)`. The helper handles preventing default drag events, toggling visual states, and assigning files to the input while triggering the `change` event.
